# Smart-Parking-Management-System
## Abstract
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a Smart Parking Management System integrating Arduino and MATLAB technologies. This inventive smart system aims to solve parking management problems and challenges by proposing an intelligent, cost-effective solution. With the help of MATLAB GUI, the system would be controlled and monitored, allowing the optimization of parking space utilization while minimizing costs. This project serves as a useful demonstration of the microcontroller technology in enhancing real-life problems, offering smart and efficient solutions.

## Introduction and Objectives
Nowadays almost every family own a car or two to be used in the transportation needs. Widening and generalizing this scope to describe for example big cities will definitely cause serious problems that start with traffic jam, unnecessary accidents and the decrease and unorganized parking of parks in the streets. In order to find a practical solution, a Smart Parking Management System is designed and explained in this report. The objectives of the system can be summarized in the following:
1.	Design a Low-cost and effective solution using Arduino.
2.	Integrate MATLAB to create a Graphical user Interface to control the system and receive feedback.
3.	Implement a prototype of the design to be tested in a small real-time simulation to assess the effectiveness of the Control system.

7.	Jumper Wires
8.	Servo Motor x1
9.	Resistor 220 Ω x3

Software Requirements:

1.MATLAB

## Project Development Procedures
This project consists of two parts, the GUI using MATLAB design and the system design and implementation with Arduino microcontroller. We will start by preparing and programming the GUI with MATLAB.
MATLAB enables us to create a graphical user interface that should first of all contain two buttons in order to start and stop the system as needed. In addition to that, the window should also show the status of the system if either “ON” or “OFF”. We can never forget that the GUI will definitely show the vacant and occupied spaces in the parking lot and a text label to indicate the number of free remaining parking lots. This will enable the user to visualize and read the free spaces as the free space will be colored in green and when occupied the slot will turn color into red.
